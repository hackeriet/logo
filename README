History
-------

It might have been back in the summer of 2009, after we founded 
the Oslo Hackerspace and decided on the name of the space -  Hackeriet - that 
we announced a logo competition. 
We got some great contributions, but it quickly became clear which one was 
the most liked. 

Atluxity came up with the original design. 
Comotion cleaned it up. 
Sjn straightened it out. 

Bob's your uncle, the hackeriet logo was born.
